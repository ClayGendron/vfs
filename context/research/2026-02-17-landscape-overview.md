# Landscape Overview

- **Date:** 2026-02-17 (research conducted)
- **Source:** migrated from `research/landscape-overview.md` on 2026-04-18
- **Status:** snapshot — landscape findings remain current; any VFS API surface references reflect the v0.1 alpha and have been superseded by the v2 architecture

## Industry Direction

The AI agent ecosystem is converging on **"everything is a file" as the core abstraction for agent context management**. This has been validated independently by multiple sources:

- **LangChain Deep Agents** (late 2025) — pluggable filesystem backend with composite mount routing
- **LlamaIndex** — published "Files Are All You Need" arguing files are the primary AI agent interface
- **Letta MemFS** — git-backed filesystem for agent memory with progressive disclosure
- **Turso AgentFS** — SQLite-backed POSIX-like VFS purpose-built for AI agents
- **AFS Paper** ("Everything is Context", Dec 2025) — academic formalization of the agentic file system concept
- **LangChain Blog** — "models are specifically trained to understand traversing filesystems"

VFS's (currently `Grover` in code) foundational principle — everything is a file path — is directly aligned with where the industry is heading.

## Competitive Positioning

| System | Versioned FS | Knowledge Graph | Semantic Search | Agent-Oriented | Local-First |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **VFS** | Yes (diffs) | Yes (rustworkx) | Yes (usearch) | Yes | Yes |
| Deep Agents | No | No | No | Yes | Partial |
| AgentFS (Turso) | CoW snapshots | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Letta MemFS | Git-based | No | Via tools | Memory only | Yes |
| MCP Filesystem | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Cursor | No | Internal only | Cloud only | No (product) | No |
| Aider | Git commits | Repo map | No | No (product) | Yes |
| Code-Graph-RAG | No | Yes (Memgraph) | Yes (UniXcoder) | Partial | No |
| lakeFS | Git-like | No | No | No | No |
| JuiceFS | No | No | No | No | No |

**VFS is the only system with all five properties.** No competitor offers the integrated versioning + knowledge graph + semantic search stack.

## Key Gaps in the Market

1. **No agent framework provides versioned file access.** Deep Agents, MCP, and every other framework treat files as current-state-only. No history, no diffs, no rollback.

2. **No agent framework integrates a knowledge graph at the filesystem level.** Code agents build internal dependency graphs (Aider's repo map, Augment's semantic dependency graph, Greptile's codegraph) but these are proprietary and not reusable.

3. **Semantic search is always cloud-hosted for code agents.** Cursor uses Turbopuffer, Augment uses Google Cloud, Sourcegraph is enterprise SaaS. No lightweight local-first semantic search exists for agent toolkits.

4. **No sandbox provides versioned file access.** Agents in E2B, Modal, or Fly.io sandboxes use raw filesystem operations with no undo, history, or diff tracking.

5. **Agent memory and code understanding are siloed.** Letta handles memory well but has no code analysis. Code agents have code understanding but no structured memory.

## Prioritized Expansion Opportunities

### High Priority
1. **deepagents BackendProtocol implementation** — immediate integration path
2. **MCP Server** — broadest reach across AI clients
3. **Agent memory layer** — positions VFS as infrastructure for memory systems

### Medium Priority
4. **Content-addressable storage** — deduplication and integrity for versioning
5. **Zero-copy branching** — agent sandboxing and speculative edits
6. **Enhanced semantic code search** — code-to-NL translation before embedding
7. **Sandbox integration adapters** — E2B, Modal, Fly.io

### Long Term
8. **AFS reference implementation** — formal alignment with academic framework
9. **Multi-agent collaboration** — agent-to-agent file sharing
10. **Cloud-native backend** — S3/GCS object storage
11. **FUSE mount** — standard Unix tool compatibility
12. **PostgreSQL RLS** — defense-in-depth for SaaS
