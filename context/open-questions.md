# Open Questions

**Status:** placeholder
**Purpose:** A single list of unknowns, undecided calls, and parked ideas. Anything tagged `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` anywhere in `/context` should have a pointer here.

## Format

```
## <short title>
- **Asked:** YYYY-MM-DD by <who>
- **Context:** 1-2 sentences of what prompted the question
- **Blocking:** list of specs/plans/decisions that are waiting on this
- **Options considered:** bullet list
- **Status:** open | parked | resolved (→ link to decision or story that closed it)
```

## Lifecycle

- **open** — actively unresolved; blocks work
- **parked** — deliberately deferred; not blocking but not forgotten
- **resolved** — closed by a decision or story; keep the entry and link to what closed it

Resolved questions stay in this file as a record; they are not deleted. If the list grows long, split resolved ones into `open-questions-archive.md`.
